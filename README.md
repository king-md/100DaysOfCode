# 100 Days Of Code - A Challenge to Write some Code for 100 Days

************************************************************************************
* NOTE: I have retired this repo.  Take a look at the 100DaysOfCodeReboot instead. *
************************************************************************************

I created this project to help me with learning any programming language.
I stole the idea from [PyBites 100 Days of Code Challenge](https://github.com/pybites/100DaysOfCode).
While the PyBites version is designed for 100 consecutive days, my own 100 days here will be 100 individual days, though not consecutive.
While I will work toward completing the 100 days in approximately 100 calendar days, I have a number of days over the next few months where I will be off grid and may not be able to avoid some calendar holes.
I'll begin this with Python, and after completing it for Python, I'll consider repeating it for another programming language (I have anumber I want to either learn or get better at).
