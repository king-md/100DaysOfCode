# 100 Days Of Code - Day 013

Day 013 -  Read an email file (headers/body) and parse.
    This day was for starting from a different angle.  Continue writing in a more object oriented way and get into building out the parse methods of the various RFC-822 Header classes (taking time to do many of the Received Headers pieces descently).
